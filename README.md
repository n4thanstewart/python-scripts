# The Flower Game

My adaptation of The Flower Game, featured in [Book: Unveiling](https://www.ishtar-collective.net/categories/book-unveiling), from Destiny 2 Lore.

## How to run:

Copy the code into a Python IDE **or** download and run the _.zip_ exec file, both contain coloured console output.

## Source Material

> These are the rules of a game. Let it be played upon an infinite two-dimensional grid of flowers.
>- Rule One. A living flower with less than two living neighbors is cut off. It dies.
>- Rule Two. A living flower with two or three living neighbors is connected. It lives.
>- Rule Three. A living flower with more than three living neighbors is starved and overcrowded. It dies.
>- Rule Four. A dead flower with exactly three living neighbors is reborn. It springs back to life.

Whilst the grid is unfortunately not infinite, the rules are in play to form this simple game of flowers similar to how it is described in the Grimoire.

This is only a fun interpretation of the game as I read it, whilst learning about Destiny's complex story.
