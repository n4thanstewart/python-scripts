Although it doesn't look exactly like the real matrix patterns from the film, it's similar in appearance, using binary streaks of 1s and 0s instead of symbols.

Run the script in a Python IDE or download and run the executable file. Enter a value for height, width and opacity (how densely the pattern should generate).

For coloured outputs, run in an IDE.
